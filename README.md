# Minecraft_Mod_Making
I'm trying to write a Minecraft Mod. I use the IDE IntelliJ-IDEA. But there are some Errors if i try to run it.

Thank you for help me with this project. As i said there are some Errors in my code. Like: 
"Disconnected from the target VM, address: '**************', transport: 'socket'"

Later you can add your own code to the mod. But only if i think your idea is great.
